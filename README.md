### Overview
* Intro
* Figma
* Images

**Intro**

This is a project about traveling across the US. All of the text and photos were provided for me, and I used CSS and HTML to ensure the content properly rendered on devices of different sizes. This project dynamically adjusts content at 1280px 1024px 768px and 420px.

**Figma**

All of the content was provided to me through a Figma project where I was able to export all images and convert them through a third party tool to optimize effiency. I was also able to better understand the sizing expectations through Figma.

**Images**

All of the images on this website have been converted through tinypng to ensure optomization. 


This has been a very fun project and has provided me with much needed work on my CSS skills.
